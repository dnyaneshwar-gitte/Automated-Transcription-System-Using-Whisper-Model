Automated Transcription System Using Whisper Model

Project Description

The Automated Transcription System is a Python-based application that uses OpenAI's Whisper model to automatically transcribe audio and video files placed in a monitored directory. It supports transcription in Hindi and can handle both audio and video formats. Transcriptions are saved as text files in the 'transcriptions' directory.

Hindi Language Support: Transcribes directly to Hindi using Whisper.

Real-Time Monitoring: Automatically transcribes new files added to the directory.

Error Handling: Skips already processed files and manages unsupported formats.
